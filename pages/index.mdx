# **Basic Book Shop with React and Flask!**

This project was mainly inspired by our College course and can be used to inspire more students in their learning process too! We used several programming languages (Python and JavaScript) and also a bit of HTML and CSS.

## Quick Start

<Callout type="info">
  You can check our Github V2 project in [Colares Editora](https://github.com/JoaoVitorFigueiredo/colareseditora/blob/v2) or follow our guide bellow.
</Callout>

<Cards num={1}>
  <Cards.Card

    arrow
    title="Start guide"
    href="/setup"
  >
    <>![Start guide](../assets/setup-guide.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>
