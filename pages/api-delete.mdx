# DELETE methods

_The DELETE method is used to remove data from a database. When a client sends a DELETE request, it is requesting that the resource at the specified URL be removed. For example, a DELETE request to the /books/12 endpoint will permanently remove the product with an ID of 123 from the database._ ~ Postman adapted.
