# POST methods

_The POST method is used to create new resources. For instance, if the manager of our book store wanted to add a new product to the database, they would send a POST request to the /products endpoint. Unlike GET requests, POST requests typically include a request body, which is where the client specifies the attributes of the resource to be created._ ~ Postman adapted.

## JSON Payload for Books - Practical Example

The client sends a JSON payload with the parameters, which the server processes to make a specific action (like adding/editing a book document).

```python filename="post.py" copy
data = request.get_json()
```

## Body (form-data) for Users - Practical Example

The client sends a Body (form-data) with the values and keys, which the server processes to make a specific action.

```python filename="post.py" copy
    username = request.form.get("username")
    password = request.form.get("password")

```
