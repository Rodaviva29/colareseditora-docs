# PUT methods

_The PUT method is used to replace an existing resource with an updated version. This method works by replacing the entire resource (i.e., the specific product located at the /books/12 endpoint) with the data that is included in the requestâ€™s body. This means that any fields or properties not included in the request body are deleted, and any new fields or properties are added.._ ~ Postman adapted.
