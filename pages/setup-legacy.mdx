<Steps>

### Clone the front-end and backend project
 
Copy the repository using the following command and directly go to the right directory:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/JoaoVitorFigueiredo/colareseditora.git && cd colareseditora
```
 
### Install project dependencies
 
```bash copy
npm install
```

### Start the development front-end server

```bash copy
npm start
```

**Note:** If any of the required ports are already in use, you can change them in the `package.json` file under the `start` script. For example:
```json copy
"start": "PORT=4000 react-scripts start"
```

### Install json-server module

This package and module need to be installed globally to work.
 
```bash copy
npm install -g json-server@0.17.4
```

**Note:** Ensure that you install version 0.17.4 as newer versions may not support certain functionalities.

### Start the localhost JSON server and pack and go!

```bash copy
json-server --watch db.json --port 3030
```
